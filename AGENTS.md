# Agent Instructions

This repository hosts the Keeper Secrets Manager Spring Boot starter alongside other integrations.

- Most development is done in `integration/spring-boot-starter-keeper-ksm`. That directory has its own `AGENTS.md` with detailed build instructions.
- Always consult and follow that file when working on the starter. It requires JDK 21 and running `./gradlew test` before committing.
- For other parts of the repo, keep documentation and configuration consistent with the existing style.
